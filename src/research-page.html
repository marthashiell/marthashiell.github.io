My PhD research investigated plasticity in the auditory cortex, which means that I studied how the brain can change and adapt in the areas that are responsible for processing sound. For this, I worked with people who were born deaf or became deaf very early in life, and looked at how their auditory cortices were different from people with normal hearing. This work highlighted to me how little we know about the function of the auditory cortex, and led to my post-doctoral research in auditory spatial processing. 

Keep reading to learn more about what I've found out...

### The auditory cortex of deaf people reorganizes to process visual motion.

In deaf people, the structures of the auditory cortex still exist, but since these structures don't get any input from the ears, they can change their function to do other things. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), I measured activity in the brain's of deaf people while they watched moving objects. I found that a specific region of the auditory cortex, known as the planum temporale region (PTR), was activated by visual motion instead of sound. The activity of the PTR also correlated with activity in the visual cortex, which meant that the auditory and visual circuitry were communicating more in deaf people. The degree of these changes varied with the amount of residual hearing that each individual had: the more deaf a person was over their lifetime, the more the auditory cortex was involved in visual processing.[<sup>1</sup>](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_00683#.V7m_Jz4rK2w)

### Deaf people are better than hearing people at detecting visual motion.
Since deaf people had extra brain areas involved in visual motion processing, I wanted to see if they actually had better vision too. I tested deaf and hearing people on a task that measured the smallest amount of visual motion that could be detected, and found that deaf people were more sensitive to visual motion than hearing people.[<sup>2</sup>](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090498) We suspect that this extra sensitivity is supported by reorganization of the auditory cortex, and that it helps deaf people detect interesting events in the environment, which may partially compensate for their lack of hearing.

### The anatomy of the auditory cortex changes according to how well deaf people detect visual motion.
Finally, I wanted to understand what changes in the auditory cortex of deaf people were related to their enhanced visual motion detection ability. For this, I used MRI to measure the structure of two different types of tissue in the brain: grey and white matter. Grey matter tissue contains all of the cell bodies of the neurons, which are the building-blocks of the brain that generate its activity. Grey matter is primarily situated on the outside surface of the brain, and encapsulates the white matter, which contains all of the connections between neurons across different parts of the cortex.

I found that the visual motion detection ability of deaf people correlated with the thickness of their grey matter in the PTR,[<sup>3</sup>](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/np/2016/7217630/abs/) the same region that was active in response to visual motion. Individuals with better motion sensitivity had thicker grey matter. Likewise, the integrity of the white matter in the PTR correlated with visual motion detection ability.[<sup>4</sup>](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378595516301198) These correlations support the hypothesis that the PTR reorganizes to support the improved visual abilities of deaf people, and give some indication of the underlying structural changes that facilitate this plasticity.

### Coming soon: Deaf and hearing people can synchronize to music felt through the floor.

With evidence that the auditory cortex reorganized in deaf people to support vision, I wondered if it could also support other senses, like the sense of touch. If that was the case, then it might be that deaf people used touch to compensate for their lack of hearing under certain circumstances. One possible scenario for this would be in a typical social dance enviroment, where a group of people are synchronizing dance moves to a musical beat. If the music is loud enough, you can often feel the beat through the vibrations in the floor. 

To test if deaf people could synchronize to "musical" vibrations felt through the floor, we used a special platform that translated musical tracks into vibrations that were similar to those experienced through a floor. We asked our participants to bounce to the beat, and recorded their movements. We found that both deaf and hearing people could synchronize to vibrations, which indicated that this ability does not depend on previous experience with sound. Since deaf people were no better than hearing people, there is no evidence that the auditory cortex of deaf people reorganizes to support the ability synchronize. However, we did find that hearing people were better at synchronizing to music that they hear as compared to music that they feel, which may mean that our sense of hearing is just better than other senses for coordinating movements.

### In progress: Auditory spatial processing for scene analysis and localization

The PTR, the area of the auditory cortex that was the focus of my Ph.D. research, is activated in all types of auditory tasks, but it is especially well-known for being sensitive to sounds that originate from different locations. When our brain encodes spatial information about a sound, it can use that information to help us locate interesting events and objects in our environment, a process called spatial localization. But our brains can also use spatial information to help us group sounds into different objects and make sense of them. For example, if two people talk to you at the same time, you can understand one of them better if both people are standing in different places than when they are standing together. This process is called scene analysis. Not a lot of research has investigated how space is used for scene analysis, and very little is known about how this process occurs in the cortex. I'm hoping to make some ground in my post-doctoral research, so stayed tuned for updates to learn more!
