### Collaborators

My Ph.D. Supervisor, [Robert Zatorre](http://www.zlab.mcgill.ca/home.php), who made my Ph.D. research happen.  
Our collaborator, [François Champoux](http://eoa.umontreal.ca/departement/professeurs-chercheurs/francois-champoux/), who was involved in much of my Ph.D. work on vision and the auditory cortex in deaf people.  
My colleagues at [BRAMS](http://www.brams.org/en/), [Pauline Tranchant](http://www.brams.umontreal.ca/plab/people/tranchant_p) and [Isabelle Peretz](http://www.brams.umontreal.ca/plab), who used their expertise to measure beat synchronization in deaf people.  
My colleagues at [CIRMMT](http://www.cirmmt.org/), [Marcello Giordano](http://www.idmil.org/people/marcello_giordano) and [Marcelo Wanderley](http://www.idmil.org/home), who know how to translate music into vibrations.  
My current supervisor, [Elia Formisano](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/e.formisano), and our collaborator [Federico de Martino](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/f.demartino/research), who are supporting my new projects.
