## My Research

For a list of my publications and citations, check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=tRU8gt4AAAAJ&hl=en) page.

My PhD research investigated plasticity in the auditory cortex, which means that I studied how the brain can change and adapt in the areas that are responsible for processing sound. For this, I worked with people who were born deaf or became deaf very early in life, and looked at how their auditory cortices were different from people with normal hearing. This work highlighted to me how little we know about the function of the auditory cortex, and led to my post-doctoral research in auditory spatial processing.

### The auditory cortex of deaf people reorganizes to process visual motion.

In deaf people, the structures of the auditory cortex still exist, but since these structures don't get any input from the ears, they can change their function to do other things. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), I measured activity in the brain's of deaf people while they watched moving objects. I found that a specific region of the auditory cortex, known as the planum temporale region (PTR), was activated by visual motion instead of sound. The activity of the PTR also correlated with activity in the visual cortex, which meant that the auditory and visual circuitry were communicating more in deaf people. The degree of these changes varied with the amount of residual hearing that each individual had: the more deaf a person was over their lifetime, the more the auditory cortex was involved in visual processing. 

### Deaf people are also better than hearing people at detecting visual motion.
Since deaf people had extra brain areas involved in visual motion processing, I wanted to see if they actually had better vision too. I tested deaf and hearing people on a task that measured the smallest amount of visual motion that could be detected, and found that deaf people were more sensitive to visual motion than hearing. We suspect that this extra sensitivity is supported by reorganization of the auditory cortex.

### The anatomy of the auditory cortex changes according to how well deaf people detect visual motion.
Finally, I wanted to understand what changes in the auditory cortex of deaf people were related to their enhanced visual motion detection ability. For this, I used two techniques from MRI: cortical thickness, and diffusion-weighted imaging. These techniques measure the structure of two different types of tissue in the brain: grey and white matter. Grey matter tissue contains all of the cell bodies of the neurons, which are the building-blocks of the brain that generate its activity. Grey matter is primarily situated on the outside surface of the brain, and encapsulates the white matter, which contains all of the structures that connect neurons across different parts of the cortex.

I found that the visual motion detection ability of deaf people correlated with the thickness of their cortex in the PTR, the same region that was active in response to visual motion. Individuals with better motion sensitivity had thicker cortex. Likewise, the integrity of the white matter that lay below the PTR correlated with visual motion detection ability. These correlations support the hypothesis that the PTR reorganizes to support the improved visual abilities of deaf people, and give some indication of the underlying structural changes that facilitate this plasticity.

### In progress: Auditory spatial processing for scene analysis and localization

The PTR, the area of the auditory cortex that was the focus of my Ph.D. research, is involved in
